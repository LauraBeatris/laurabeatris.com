            When I was on high school, wondering what would be my major,
            I've saw on technology a opportunity to meet people from all over the world and that's why I decided to start studying Python and programming fundamentals even before starting college.

            When I started a Bachelor's Degree in Analysis and Systems Development, I
            often would get home everyday and put everything that I learned on my GitHub profile, and this helped a lot to land my first job as a Full Stack Developer.
