          When I was on high school, wondering what would be my major,
          I've saw on technology a opportunity to meet people from all over the world and that's why I decided to start studying Python and programming fundamentals even before starting college.

          When I started a Bachelor's Degree in Analysis and Systems Development, I
          often would get home everyday and put everything that I learned on my GitHub profile, and this helped a lot to land my first job as a Full Stack Developer.

          Since I started to program, I'm a real believer in learning in public and
          I always try to share the knowledge that I gained throughout my journey with the community.
